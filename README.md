## Problems and Solution

- [x] couldn't do axios in functional component. solved it by usding class component
- [x] didn't know how to fetch copuntry name. Sol: Brought another api top solve that.
- [x] How to load local json file. Sol: [Medium Post Here](https://medium.com/officialrajdeepsingh/how-to-read-local-json-file-in-react-js-564125235fc7)
- [x] setState doesn't update the state immediately. Sol: "Your state needs some time to mutate, and since console.log(this.state.boardAddModalShow) executes before the state mutates, you get the previous value as output. So you need to write the console in the callback to the setState function:
      openAddBoardModal() {
      this.setState({ boardAddModalShow: true }, function () {
      console.log(this.state.boardAddModalShow);
      });
      }"

- [x] Json fil data recieved but not able to show the data using ".map()". Sol: Used '{}' instead of '()' after '=>'
- [ ] When I type, the heading also changes with it.
- [ ] when I hit search button twice, it gives an error. Probably due to "Dhaka" and not "dhaka"
